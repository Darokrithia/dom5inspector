  MA SHAMBHALA: THE HIDDEN CITY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  VERSION HISTORY
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The change log for versions before the most recent versions for Dominions 4
have been summarized.



POTENTIAL THINGS TO DO
----------------------

* Change Rta Dmag Go's sprite to add a bow.

* Lha hero (thug? multihero? Great Glacier Lady of the Turquoise Mists? --
  possibly latter one as alternate new pretender).

* Possibly make Rje into a multihero?

* Totally missing pretender: Yarlhashampo (yar-lha-sham-po)
  http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/16ii/Xie_Jisheng.pdf
  The highest of the nine creator mountain-gods of the Bon-po religion. (Based
  on the ascendance of the Yar-lung tribe, whose patron god it was.) Often
  "portrayed as white yak, from whose mouth and nose snowstorms continuously
  blow. He is endowed with extraordinary magical powers: he can destroy rocks,
  cause floods, and even transform himself into a white man in order to have
  sexual intercourse with women and father babies." Awesome. Might be good as
  an EA god if that ever happens. MA form would be dictated by: "As the myths
  about the mountain developed, images of yar-lha-shampo also changed; a white
  yak was replaced by a man-god clothed in white with a body as white as a
  conch, holding a short spear with colorful silk flags and a crystal sword in
  his hands. This human image of yar-lha-shampo is typically accompanied by a
  wife and children. His wife is gnam-smanthog-gi-bu-yug, the primary
  goddess. She is clothed in light red attire, holds lightning in her right
  hand and hailstones in her left, and flies on bolts of lightning."

* Find a way to make Yeh-teh balanced *and* stealthy per lore?

Version 4.00
-----------------------------

Yeh-Teh gained Fear 5
Frozen Llama W2S1 > W1
Pretenders with Immortal switched to DomImmortal
Debt of Karma Rage > Confusion, changed description


Version 3.99E (Jul 31, 2014)
-----------------------------

Many more significant balancing changes this version as we slowly progress 
toward bringing this well-heeled nation into line.

A big change is that I've removed all inherent access to Fire magic for this 
nation, and made Water more accessible, though Water still remains minor 
access. Thanks to Ohlmann for pointing out that no nation in the game has 
access to all 8 paths (aside from heroes or unreliable randoms), and to 
Indract for suggesting the switch to Water.  Which, really, is far more 
thematic than Fire for these guys.  I don't know why it never occurred to me.

Special thanks to Indract, Ohlmann and Zonk for extensive feedback, help and 
bug reporting for this version. The majority of changes in this version are 
adoptions of their suggestions or changes consequent to their advice.

*  Fixed several bugs: Mi Dred Mtho Po's awe now works properly. Snow Lions'
   fear now works properly (Indract).
*  Many units have had morale adjusted.
*  Fixed mountain-only ritual spells so they can be cast in border-mountain 
   provinces as well.
*  Temples now more expensive: 400 -> 500 gold (Indract).
*  Nation cannot start in caves anymore.
*  Dörje weapon is no longer ranged.
*  Nation only gets 10 of each of its starting units instead of 12 (Indract).

*  Unit Changes:

   *  Most units have had morale decreased, as they were all unjustifiably 
      high. The only direct exception was the Bhodpa Sde Pa (tribal chief), 
      who got 10 -> 11.
   *  All mages/pretenders that had Dörje weapon have had their Fist weapon 
      removed now that Dörje is no longer ranged (if it is ranged, it doesn't 
      count as a hand weapon, even if it's usable in melee, and therefore 
      would cause them all to get useless kick; fist was a clunky workaround 
      for this).
   *  Mi Go units: Now requires a temple to recruit.
   *  Bhodpa Horseman: Gcost 22 -> 26 (Indract).
   *  Yak Rider: Gcost 27 -> 30 (Indract, Ohlmann).
   *  Dmag Dar: Gcost 14 -> 20 and mapmove 1 -> 2 (Indract).
   *  Rta Pa: Gcost 35 -> 45 and map move 2 -> 3 (Indract).
   *  Guardian of the Hidden Valley: Incorrect def 14 fixed -> 13.

   *  Mi Go Guide: Now requires a temple to recruit. 
   *  Dmag Dpon: Gcost 70 -> 80 (Indract).
   *  Rta Dmag Go: Gcost 85 -> 100; now has composite bow and map move 3 
     (Indract).
   *  Rje: Gcost 140 -> 180. Inspirational 2 -> 1.

   *  Ragyapa: Gcost 85 -> 105.
   *  Ngagspa: Now is heretic 1 and incurs 1.0 unrest per turn (Indract).
   *  Demon Hunter: Changed F magic to W magic. Morale 15 -> 13. HP 10 -> 11. 
      Gcost 85 -> 95. Now has patrol bonus 10, research malus -2, and incurs 1 
      unrest per turn. Thanks to Indract for suggestions on this.
   *  Nyingmapa: Fire randoms switched to water (Indract). Stealth 40 -> 55.
   *  Hidden Master: Removed Useless Kick.

   *  Demon Slayer: Magic paths changed to H2-W2-S2-D1 + 100% chance of AWED + 
      100% chance of AWED + 30% chance of DB. Now has patrol bonus 20, 
      research malus -4, and incurs 3 unrest per turn. Thanks likewise to 
      Indract for suggestions on this.
   *  Mi Dred Mtho Po: Awe works properly (Indract).

   *  Snow Lion: Fear works properly now (Indract).
   *  Srungma Lha: Forgebonus 15 -> fixforgebonus 1 (Indract).
   *  Theurang: Forgebonus 1 -> Fixforgebonus 1 (Indract).
   
   *  Mother of Mountains: Pretender cost 125 -> 50 (Indract).

*  Spell changes:

   *  Contact the Lords of the Cemetary: Fixed and will now show up (Indract).
   *  Call Yeh-Teh: Second path Earth 1 -> Nature 1 (Indract).
   *  White Fury of the Mountain: Gem cost 35 -> 30 and second path Earth 1 -> 
      Nature 1 (Indract).
   *  Restore the Dharma: No longer works against mindless; fixed (Indract).

*  Item changes:

   *  Terma: Changed autospell "Restore the Dharma" to autospellrepeat, which
      should make it now cast repeatedly properly (Indract).
   *  Shambhalan Mirror Armor (magic item): Renamed "Enchanted Mirror 
      Lamellar". MR bonus 2 -> 3; linked with new armor of the same name that 
      has better stats than the regular regular mirror lamellar worn by most 
      elite units; def bonus removed and incorporated into the associated 
      #newarmor item itself.
   *  New armor item "Enchanted Mirror Lamellar": Associated with magic item.
      Has higher prot (16 -> 17), higher def (-2 -> 1) and lower enc (2 -> 1)
      (Indract).



Version 3.99B2 (May 14, 2014)
-----------------------------

Now that I have become more familiar with Dom4 and its fairly sweeping and 
fundamental changes, this version again will begin some equally sweeping 
changes to bring it into line with the new balance. As of this version, 
Shambhala is being balanced against straight vanilla Dom4, which only makes 
sense since CBM has not been updated yet and is likely in a high degree of 
flux.

Many, if not most, gold costs have been adjusted, sometimes drastically 
(usually in line with the autocalc's recommendation).

Some pretty significant changes to Mi Gö that amount to a bit of a nerf, but I 
think their high speed (AP 14!) was unwarranted both technically and 
thematically. They're basically snow ape men, and our closest equivalent, 
bandar, have AP 10. So, I thought 11 is a good compromise; they're still 
faster, but not by much. And with cold power, they're still very strong units.

[*] As always, text emendations to improve flow and cut down on verbiage (this 
    time correcting my own problems, more often).

[*] Terrain-limited spellcasting disabled until I am positive the bug that 
    makes this not work correctly has been fixed by Illwinter.

[*] New Weapons:

    [*] Gore -- for Yak Riders (see changes for Yak Riders below).
    [*] Gore -- for riderless Yaks (see changes for Yak Riders below).
    [*] Dmu Great Kukri -- magical large sword for Srin Po Swordsmen.
    [*] Dörje -- ritual sacred object held by Hidden Masters.
    [*] Sword of Truth -- magical/symbolic sword held by Bodhisattva 
        pretender.

[*] New Armor:

    [*] Leather Lamellar Armor -- replaces Full Leather Armor for Mda Pa.

[*] New Magic Items:

    [*] Thokcha
    [*] Namchak Thokcha
    [*] Shambhalan Mirror Armor
    [*] Sacred Phurba
    [*] Empowered Dörje
    [*] Terma (artifact)
    
[*] Major changes to Hidden Masters and Ascended Ones: Ability to fly has been 
    removed. They float, which better represents the levitation in their 
    description. Generic weapon Lightning has been replaced with the more 
    thematic Dörje, which doesn't fire as far or do as much damage, but which 
    mesmerizes those hit.  Ascended One H4 -> H3.

[*] Added "Robes" armor to all robed mages and pretenders.

[*] Yeh-teh have been reconciled with Dom4's yeti. HP 36 -> 42 (slightly less 
    than yetis' 46). Enc 3 -> 2. Def 12 -> 10 (1 higher than yeti). MR 11 -> 
    13. ColdRes 18 -> 25. ColdPower 2 -> 1. Fear removed -- it was too much.

[*] Pricing adjustments:

    [*] Bhödpa Warrior: 10 -> 11.
    [*] Yak Rider: 24 -> 27.
    [*] Shangrilan Heavy Infantry (Sword/Shield): 12 -> 13.
    [*] Dmag Dar (Banner-bearer): 13 -> 14.
    [*] Rta Pa: 32 -> 35 (it rounds all numbers above 30).
    [*] Mi Gö: unchanged at 20.
    [*] Mi Gö Rngon Pa: unchanged at 24.
    [*] Mi Dred: 55 -> 50.

    [*] Bhödpa Scout: 10 -> 15.
    [*] Bhödpa Sde Pa: unchanged at 30.
    [*] Mi Gö Guide: unchanged at 35 (autocalc suggested 20).
    [*] Dmag Dpon: 50 -> 70.
    [*] Rta Dmag Go: 65 -> 85.
    [*] Rje: 90 -> 140 (autocalc suggested 155, and 165 if he has H1!).

    [*] Drapa: 90 -> 70 (autocalc suggested 60).
    [*] Ragyapa: 135 -> 70.
    [*] Demon Hunter: 170 -> 85.
    [*] Ngagspa: 180 -> 125 (autocalc suggested 100).
    [*] Wise One: unchanged at 220 (autocalc agreed).
    [*] Nyingmapa: 240 -> 275.
    [*] Gelug: 180 -> 200 (autocalc suggested 190).
    [*] Karmapa: 210 -> 240 (autocalc suggested 180-300 depending).
    [*] Hidden Master: 320 -> 360 (autocalc suggested 385 if H3).
    [*] Bodhisattva: 80 -> 90.
    

[*] Individual Unit Tweaks

    [*] Bhödpa Warrior: HP 10 -> 11.
    [*] Yak Rider: Precision 9 -> 8 to bring it into line with other mounted 
        archers. #supplybonus removed, because these are bulls they're riding, 
        not cows, and you shouldn't try to milk the bull. Original weapon, 
        standard "Gore," replaced with custom "Gore" weapon that does 17 
        nostrength damage, is a charge attack, and attacks every other round.
    [*] Bhödpa Horseman: HP 12 -> 11. Precision 10 -> 8.
    [*] Mi Gö and Mi Gö Rngon Pa: HP 20 -> 21. AP 14 -> 11.
    [*] Mi Dred: HP 25 -> 24. Scale Mail Cuirass -> Scale Mail Hauberk --
        because the sprite. At a cost of 55 gold for one, I'm fine with them 
        having a nice 16/18 prot. But this does knock them out of the role of
        fast-movers. Get yeh-tehs for that.
    [*] Rta Pa: Prec 10 -> 9.
    [*] Shambhalan Bowmen (Mda Pa): Full Leather Armor -> Lamellar Leather 
        Armor.
    [*] Dmag Dar (banner-bearers): Scale Mail Hauberk -> Full Scale Mail, to
        put them on par with the other heavy infantry they've supposedly 
        distinguished themselves from.
    [*] Rje: H1 removed. He's just a sacred thug now.
    [*] Srin Po: Att 15 -> 14.
    [*] Srin Po Swordsman: Now uses Dmu Great Kukri instead of Falchion. Bite 
        attack removed. Att 15 -> 14.
    [*] Drapa: Att 10 -> 9, because description really doesn't suggest these
        are serious fighting monks.
    [*] Nyingmapa: Research bonus 1 -> 5.
    [*] Tülku: Weapon Lightning -> Dörje. Now decreases unrest by 3 each turn.
        Added Inspirational 2.
    [*] Mi Dred Mtho Po: Bronze Scale Cuirass -> Hauberk. Inspirational 2 -> 
        1. Leadership 40 -> 80.
    [*] Btsan: Claw attacks -> Poisoned Claw attacks. 
    [*] Bdud: Berserk 1 -> 3. Att 13 -> 12.
    [*] Bdud Warrior: Berserk 1 -> 3. Att 14 -> 13.
    [*] Dgra Lha: HP 22 -> 25. AP 12 -> 14. Bodyguard 1 -> 2. Formation 
        Fighter -> removed. Stealth 10 -> 0 (it's still 65 with glamour). Att 
        15 - > 14. Def 13 -> 14. MR 16 -> 15. Stealth 10 -> 0.
    [*] Srungma Lha: AP 12 -> 14. MR 17 -> 16. Morale 15 -> 16. CastleDef 2 -> 
        5. Stealth 10 -> 0. 
    [*] Theurang: 20% chance of EAD -> 100% chance of EAD. AP 10 -> 9.
    [*] Klu: Poor Amphibian -> Amphibian. They're spirits of the water. 
        Leadership 40 -> Leadership 0. Cold Resistance 3 -> 5 in serpent form, 
        6 in humanoid form. Enc in humanoid form 4 -> 2 (as Yaksha).
    [*] Ascended Master pretender: Start Dominion 1 -> 2. Leadership 40 -> 
        160.
    [*] Bodhisattva: Renamed to Bodhisattva of Keen Awareness. Default name 
        set to Jampelyang. Floating and Flying added. Cold Resistance 8 -> 10. 
        Fixed unrest reduction to proper decimal place (was reducing 0.5 
        unrest instead of 5). Added ResearchBonus 8 (to represent his holding 
        the Prajnaparamita, the Perfection of Wisdom). Added Disbelieve 25. 
        Added glamour (not desired, but I can't add disbelieve without copy-
        statting the Bodhisattva of Mercy; she has glamour, and glamour can't 
        be removed without losing disbelieve. Added Sword of Truth weapon. 
        Leadership 80 -> 160.

[*] Other Minor Tweaks:

    [*] Phurba: Damage type changed from anti-demon damage to holy damage.
    [*] Cane Shield: Changed from Enc 1 and Parry 3 to Enc 0 and Parry 4. Cane 
        and rattan shields were surprisingly effective and light, so they're 
        now modeled after the stats for Leather Shield, but with 12 prot 
        instead of 11.
    [*] Mirror Lamellar Armor: Prot 15 -> 16. This is supposed to be some 
        damned good armor, historically, so with -2/2, this is some of the
        best nonmagical armor in the game.
    [*] Crude Breastplate: Enc 1 -> 2. It's crude, after all.
    [*] Removed 4113 dummy summon for Propitiate Srungma Lha spell, and added
        a new 'nextspell' spell to replace it.
    [*] Contact Klu, Debt of Karma, and Restore the Dharma made castable 
        underwater.
    [*] All ranged rituals had #provrange added so they should work now.
    [*] Removed #formationfighter from all commander units that had it, since
        it is irrelevant for commanders.
    [*] Fixed many summons (Bduds, Btsan, etc.) having Skull Necklaces (prot 
        11 full-body) instead of the Bone Necklaces (prot 3) added in this 
        mod.





Version 3.99B1 (Sep. 16, 2013)
------------------------------

[*] Began major overhaul to bring in line with Dom4. ID ranges moved. Fear, 
    standard, and resistances brought into line with current implementation.
    Rebalancing adjustments to cost and stats.

[*] Special recruitment implemented:

    [*] Mi Gö units, except for Mi Dred, made mountain-only recruitment.

    [*] Ngagspa can only be recruited outside forts.

    [*] Hidden Masters, Wise Ones and all Lamas are slow to recruit.


Versions 2.90 - 3.03 (Apr. 24, 2013 - May 10, 2013)
----------------------------------------------------

[*] Major revision: many deep balancing adjustments, particularly, again,  to 
    national spells and summons. One major change is that the flagship mages
    of the nation, the Hidden Masters, are no longer H3; they're only H2 now. 
    Most troops' att/def nerfed a bit for historical reasons; Tibetans were 
    not known for super elite troops so much as they were known for having a 
    *very* easily defended home. They were good during the Tibetan empires,
    but not the best.

[*] More significant alterations to descriptive text, with the goal of 
    bringing it all together into a coherent whole that will make it easier to 
    implement an EA nation in which Buddhism hasn't come, and the shamanic Bon 
    religion and its Lha and Dmu are not syncretized or driven into hiding or 
    demonized as they are now.

[*] Further revisions to several sprites.

[*] Renaming.

    [*] Nation renamed Shambhala because it is by many accounts a more 
        authentic pronunciation of the word, and for mythical and linguistic 
        consistency. Shangri-La is a westernization by a British novelist, 
        likely of Shambalha; Nounours had called it that in one spot in the 
        mod, and now that I read more about Lha, it seems very likely that's 
        not a false cognate. Shambalha would probably be the most technically 
        correct spelling, but Shambhala (note the position of the 'h') is more 
        accepted.

    [*] Secondary name of mod "Hidden City of the Secret Masters" to 
        "The Hidden City" because the original was getting truncated in the 
        game UI.
    
    [*] Site "Hidden City of Shangri-La" -> "The Hidden City" for same reaosn.
    
    [*] Yeti -> Yeh-teh for linguistic consistency. In retrospect, with Dom4's
        inclusion of Yetis, this name makes them easily-distinguishable.

[*] Spells Changes: Put a lot of thought into trying to balance yeti-summoning 
    spell. There are now two Yeh-teh summoning spells, one as the original and 
    one for small-scale summoning. On the other hand, Feast of Cannibal Demons 
    and Great Banquet of Cannibal Demons combined and made to summon both 
    kinds of Srin Po.

[*] New units: Mi Gö Guide (stealthy commander with 10 leadership) and Mi Dred 
    Mtho Pa (Mi Dred hero).

[*] New weapons and armor:

    {*] Bone Necklace (replaces vanilla Skull Necklace on Bdud Warrior, which
        was too protective).
    [*] Cane Shield (for Bhödpa).
    [*] Stones weapon for Srin Po to throw (slightly different than monkey 
        peoples' Sticks and Stones in vanilla -- this is to reflect mytho-
        history that the Srin were people in the area before the Bhödpa 
        tribesmen came, and they used slings and catapults).
    [*] Lamellar Armor and Mirror Lamellar Armor for elite Shambhalan troops,
        to reflect the historically high-quality armor and the supposedly-
        magically-protective "mirror armor" that Tibetan troops wore. (Some of 
        the best armor in history; Korean lamellar is the superheavy stuff --
        Tibetan lamellar was just really good because it was on par with heavy 
        armor but less encumbering.  Look it up, it's pretty cool.)

[*] Lha renamed -> Srungma Lha. (Lha is a very vague generic term for a whole 
    hierarchy of supernatural beings inherited from the Bon religion.)

[*] Yeh-tehs (yetis) now sacred.

TO DO: Removed stealthiness from yeh-tehs for balance reasons, but lore says 
they're really hidey. Perhaps find a way to balance it back in?  They're 
really good as it is.


Versions 1.53 - 2.05 (Jan. 28, 2011 - Feb. 16, 2011)
----------------------------------------------------

[*] Mod made compatible with CBM (Conceptual Balance Mod for Dom3).

[*} Minor bugfixes (both older bugs and ones introduced in recent changes).

[*] Further balancing and technical adjustments, with more attention on fine-
    tuning national spells and summons.

[*] Lha made significantly more powerful.

[*] Continued textual and spritework overhaul. Bdud and Bdud Warrior sprites 
    changed.


Versions 1.3 - 1.52 (Mar. 2010 - May 12, 2010)
----------------------------------------------

[*] Fixed technical errors (case-mismatched sprite filename references, 
    references to missing sprites or incorrect IDs, etc.).

[*] Changed PD from Shangrilan soldiers and Citipati to Bhödpa spearmen, 
    Bhödpa archers, Bhödpa yak riders, and basic Mi Gö.

[*] Many balance and consistency adjustments to units (stats, gold costs, 
    magic paths, etc.).

[*] Edited and revised all descriptive and flavor text, trying to keep the 
    spirit and information while paring down and cleaning up.

[*] Fixed or revamped most sprites and flag, with particular attention to
    maintaining the artistic vision of the originals.

[*] Added Lama of the Frozen Heights pretender. Added riderless Yak for when 
    Yak Riders are killed. Klu changed to be similar to Patalan Nagini instead 
    of Nagaraja.

[*] Created new mod banner (original was wrongly-sized and overpixelated) and 
    Zepath's Streamers & Standards-style flag.

[*] Created readme and other documentation.


Versions before 1.3
-----------------
I found no prior change log, so the version history shown herein begins with 
Pyg's and my revisions.
