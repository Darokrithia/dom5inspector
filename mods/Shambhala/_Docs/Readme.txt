REVISING AUTHOR'S NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nounours, the author of this mod, disappeared from the forums for a long 
while, leaving this mod in an almost-finished state. A bit later, Pyg put up a 
version on the mod's release thread that corrected a few technical errors. 
Seeing that, and finding myself charmed and impressed by his superb work, I 
decided to finish and maintain the mod, polishing it and correcting any 
remaining errors.

I've overhauled it and balanced it to the best of my ability, bringing it into
line with Dom4 standards.

The main areas of revision have been:

1) Textual editing. Nounours is an excellent non-native English speaker, but 
it's tough writing in another language. I helped clean it up a bit, and edited
things down where they were awkward or too long.

2) Added a few new sprites and variants (specifically, the Yak, the missing
Bdud Warrior, the Lama of the Frozen Heights pretender, the Mi Dred High One,
and the Mi Go Guide).

3) Overhauled the existing spritework while trying to remain consistent with
the author's style. Most sprites had minor issues such as awkward shading here
and there, stray pixels, or minor mistakes (such as the Dmag Dpon's helmet
changing color), while others, through no fault of the mod author's, were
simply based on some of KO's more outdated sprites and could stand for a bit
of an overhaul. A few -- the Klu/Naga, all cavalry units, and the Bdud and
Srin Po series -- were replaced entirely.  If I suspected that the sprite was
wholly original artwork by Nounours, as I did with the Lha sprites, I took
special care to adhere to the original artistic vision.

4) Applied extensive fixes, balancing adjustments, technical updating, and 
other polishing. A lot of love has gone into it.

5) Added a small amount of new content: a pretender, several new units, 
   spells, weapons and armor.

If you like this mod, but find it imbalanced in some way (particularly for MP 
play, since I haven't played MP much and don't have a feel for it), please do 
pipe up and let me know how it could be improved.

Nounours, thanks and cheers to you for this incredibly good nation mod.  I 
hope you'll continue with your fine work! (I would love to see Cantabira 
finished!)  And I sincerely hope you like the direction in which I've taken 
this outstanding mod.

aspects of the mod, and to llamabeast for graciously allowing me use of space
