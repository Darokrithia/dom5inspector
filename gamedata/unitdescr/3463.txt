Jinnun are spiritual beings born from Smokeless Flame in a distant past. They replaced the Hinn and Binn during the reign of a previous Pantokrator. They are naturally invisible and ethereal, but can take physical form when they interact with men. The Jinnun live in Ubar, a magic desert kingdom of marvelous riches. The City of Brass fielde armies of Jinnun, wielding magic and armed with enchanted weapons. These Jinn Warriors follow the call of their Sultans and prepare to conquer the lands claimed by mankind in an effort to restore magic to the world. There are many Jinn races with different abilities and powers, but they are all born from Smokeless Flame and therefore strongly attuned to magic, ethereal and invisible unless they wish to be seen. Jinnun are vulnerable to iron and salt and the Jinn Warriors of Ubar use armaments of bronze.
