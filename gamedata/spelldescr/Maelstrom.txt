A huge magical maelstrom is created in a sea. The maelstrom constantly sucks in huge amounts of water and filters out its magical essence. This results in a huge amount of magic gems for the caster. Each month 15 water, 5 astral, 3 air and 1 of each other gem type is generated. The enchantment lasts until someone dispels it or the caster dies.
