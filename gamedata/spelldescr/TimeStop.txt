This powerful alteration will slow down time to almost a standstill for everyone but the caster. Any ongoing effects like regeneration or heat clouds will also be slowed down, regardless if they affect the caster or not. The time stop lasts for about 5 combat rounds. There can only be one time stop in effect at once, a new one will replace an ongoing one.
