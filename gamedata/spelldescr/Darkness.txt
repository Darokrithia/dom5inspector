The battlefield is covered in a darkness strong enough to render torches almost useless. Most ordinary beings will stumble and have great difficulty fighting or shooting in the darkness. Demons, blind beings and beings with spirit sight or perfect darkvision are unaffected by this spell. The darkness ends if the caster dies.
