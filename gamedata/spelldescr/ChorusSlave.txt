The witches and bards of Man have developed the spellsinging techniques of the Tuatha further. Through communal chanting they are able to strengthen the arcane harmonies of their spell songs. Chorus slaves only follow the chant the Chorus Masters and are inactive during the battle. If a chorus slave loses consiousness they leave the communal chant. Only spellsingers can cast this spell, but regular communion masters can use chorus slaves.
